# aac-shelteredcat-outcomes
Predictive classification model to analyze and forecast outcomes for sheltered cats using machine learning techniques. Developed from October 2024 to Novemeber 2024.

The data used is from Austin Animal Center, the largest no-kill shelter in the United States. As part of the City of Austin's Open Data Initative, the shelter makes their data available to the general public. The CSV file is posted on Kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and?select=aac_shelter_cat_outcome_eng.csv

The Austin Animal Center helps over 18,000 animals yearly by providing shelter and care. The center participates in county, city, and state-wide initiatives focused on protecting and caring for abandoned, at-risk, and surrendered animals. 

The chosen machine learning problem is predicting the length of time a cat will take to get adopted from the Austin Animal Center based on specific characteristics. Parameters include the breed of the cat, age upon arrival, sex, color, and fixed (spayed/neutered/neither) status. This information can help shelters better manage resources and optimize efforts to decrease the time in the shelter before being adopted. 

Furthermore, this prediction problem is interesting and relevant to issues found in shelters worldwide. Understanding what characteristics affect adoption time regionally can lead to targeted marketing, improved strategies for less adoptable cats, and increased overall efficiency in the shelter system. Also, this information can provide insight into human preferences in pet adoption. Highlighting these biases may help manage and mitigate them.

Because of the specific data used, the Austin Animal Center has the largest benefit of this machine learning model; however, other animal shelters and rescue organizations can adopt similar approaches. Other users of this model could be animal welfare advocates, policymakers, and pet adoption platforms. The model can help animal advocates address trends in animal adoption, encouraging the implementation of new policies and programs to increase adoption rates. Also, pet adoption websites could offer predicted adoption times to potential cat parents to help make more informed decisions. These websites could highlight less popular animals first, allowing users to see how long some cats wait to find a home.
